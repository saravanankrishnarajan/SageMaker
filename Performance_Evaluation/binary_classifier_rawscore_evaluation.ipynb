    "We need to now assess how algorithm would behave under different classification thresholds.  Instead of manually performing this step, we can compute \"AUC\" metric.  AUC refers to Area Under Curve.  The curve here refers to the plot that has Probability of False Alarm (False Positive Rate) in X-Axis and Probability of Detection (Recall) in Y-Axis. By plotting False Alarm vs Recall at different cut-off thresholds, we can form a curve.  AUC measures the area under this curve.\n",
